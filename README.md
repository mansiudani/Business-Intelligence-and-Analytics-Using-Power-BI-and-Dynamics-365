Abstract
We will explore and investigate the working pattern of SEAI (Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland). Based on the BER (Building Energy Rating) dataset, devise a business plan to achieve better efficiency and customer management. To gain insight of their overall past performance we will use visualization tools. Our focus is on the customer relationship model to increase the business capability through CRM tools.
1. Background
The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is recognized as an autonomous organization set up under the Sustainable Energy Act (SEA), 2002.
The SEAI was formed to strategize the development of renewable sources of energy. It is working with communities, householders, businesses and government to be sustainable, clean, affordable and secure. The organizations role is to transform the society of Ireland based on sustainable energy technologies, structures and practices.
SEAI acts as an intermediate in building measures to focus on activities that help in low carbon economy by transitioning to sustainable energy and a smarter future. This process is carried out swiftly through incentives and grant programmes. They will achieve energy credits towards their goals by saving every unit of energy in their projects.
SEAI is the first among public or private sustainable energy organizations in Europe to be awarded under the NSAI (National Standards Authority of Ireland) in April 2011.
